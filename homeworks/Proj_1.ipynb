      "(Minghui.org) The outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus in China and its quick spread to other parts of the world during the Chinese New Year holiday season has left many people in panic and deep frustration.The communist regime has long lost public trust on the cover-up of the spread of SARS 17 years ago. Many people are also criticizing officials in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, for their handling of the new crisis.As Minghui.org began to report on the Wuhan virus, how should we, Falun Dafa practitioners, view the outbreak and what can we do to help people who are suffering or facing the danger of being infected with the virus?I believe we should increase our capacity to show more empathy to others even though we ourselves are being persecuted by the Chinese communist regime for upholding our faith.Minghui.org has published numerous stories about non-practitioners having their health improved, minds calmed, and dangers averted by reciting “Falun Dafa is good, Truthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance is good.”With researchers around the world racing to develop vaccines against the novel deadly virus, we can also suggest that people recite “Falun Dafa is good, Truthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance is good” or even read Zhuan Falun, the main text of Falun Dafa.I trust if they truly believe in the healing power of Falun Dafa, they will be able to get better or even avoid the epidemic all together. Of course, in order for people to understand Falun Dafa, we should always maintain a compassionate heart as we talk to them face to face or via other communication channels.\n",

       "' The outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus in China and its quick spread to other parts of the world during the Chinese New Year holiday season has left many people in panic and deep frustration.The communist regime has long lost public trust on the cover-up of the spread of SARS 17 years ago. Many people are also criticizing officials in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, for their handling of the new crisis.As Minghui.org began to report on the Wuhan virus, how should we, Falun Dafa practitioners, view the outbreak and what can we do to help people who are suffering or facing the danger of being infected with the virus?I believe we should increase our capacity to show more empathy to others even though we ourselves are being persecuted by the Chinese communist regime for upholding our faith.Minghui.org has published numerous stories about non-practitioners having their health improved, minds calmed, and dangers averted by reciting “Falun Dafa is good, Truthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance is good.”With researchers around the world racing to develop vaccines against the novel deadly virus, we can also suggest that people recite “Falun Dafa is good, Truthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance is good” or even read Zhuan Falun, the\\xa0main text of Falun Dafa.I trust if they truly believe in the healing power of Falun Dafa, they will be able to get better or even avoid the epidemic all together.
