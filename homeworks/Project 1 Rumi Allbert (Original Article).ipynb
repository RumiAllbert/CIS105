      " I contacted a former classmate in Wuhan on February 2 and learned that he was infected with the coronavirus when he took his wife to a hospital. He displayed symptoms consistent with the virus, but the hospital had no vacant beds, would not test him for the virus, and only told him to isolate himself at home, where his young child and two elderly parents also lived.Some time ago, I told him about Falun Dafa and the persecution in China, and he renounced his membership in the Communist Party as a result. I asked if he still remembered the two phrases I had told him to recite when he faced danger. He said he didn’t. I told him to recite, “Falun Dafa is good” and “Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good” and suggested that his family do the same.When I contacted him again two days later, he told me, “All my symptoms were gone when I woke up this morning. My whole body feels refreshed.”This is one of many cases in which people have averted danger by reciting the two auspicious phrases. Facing the epidemic, I believe that everyone who sincerely takes these phrases to heart or reads Zhuan Falun, the main book of Falun Dafa, will receive divine protection.I hope more people will learn about how numerous Falun Dafa practitioners recovered from severe illnesses after taking up the spiritual discipline. Despite the past twenty years of persecution by the Communist Party, practitioners have persisted in telling people about Dafa so that they can benefit from it and be blessed.BackgroundFalun Gong, also called Falun Dafa, was first taught to the public in 1992. Nearly 100 million people across China were soon practicing Falun Gong after experiencing improvements in their health and character. Jiang Zemin, former head of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), perceived the spiritual discipline's growing popularity as a threat to the CCP's atheistic ideology and issued an order to ban Falun Gong on July 20, 1999.Minghui.org has confirmed the deaths of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners due to the persecution over the past 20 years; the actual number is suspected to be much higher. More have been imprisoned and tortured for their faith. There is concrete evidence that the CCP sanctions the harvesting of organs from detained practitioners, who are murdered to supply the organ transplant industry.Under Jiang's personal direction, the CCP established the 610 Office, an extralegal security organization with the power to override the police and judicial systems, and whose sole function is to carry out the persecution of Falun Gong.\n",
